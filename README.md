Then you want to go to github and merge

you then want to switch to your main branch with ```git checkout main```

## User Story
The first task for this project is to download the started code and clone my repo to my local machine. 

## Acceptance Criteria

My webpage is complete when I deploy it and it displays my css and html properly while my javascript is logged to the console, displaying random information found within my notes.

## Process 

Once that was done I then went through and added useful notes for myself for each section (HTML,CSS, JAVASCRIPT)

When my notes were finished I did not make any additional HTML changes. I moved onto CSS and began to style my webpage. 
I was given started CSS to begin with so the first thing to be done is: making the headers dark blue and putting my notes into 4 boxes with shadows behind them. 
I did this by first creating a stylesheet within VS Code and linking it with my html . These two files are now linked and my broswer is displaying my styled html properly. 
Now I have to finish formatting my stylesheet and adding final details such as shadows to the boxes containing my notes. 

I've finished applying CSS. 

The issue I'm having the most is going through the Gitflow process, I am having fatal repo errors but cannot trace the issue 

I was able to solve my github issues by working through the git flow process with my tutor. 

My HTML, Javascript, CSS and assets are linked correctly and deploy as a full interactive webpage. I look forward to adding more notes throughout my time attending bootcamp.
